# Project-Part-4.   Search Engine with Web Analytics 

## Before Starting the Web App
Before starting the web app, it is important that the folder includes two files: a JSON file containing the tweets, which should be named farmers-protest-tweets; the other file is a CSV file containing the mapping of documents with the tweet_id and should be named tweet_document_ids_map. Both files can be found here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UEizot0aYHSPVGko7EIZ1kH00O11Gyr2?usp=drive_link.
It is also important to note that the web app may take some time to run initially, as the first thing it does when starting is calculate the inverted index. Once the initial search page is loaded, it should work normally. If this is not the case, you can run it using a smaller corpus.

## Starting the Web App

```bash
python -V
# Make sure you are using Python 3
# Before running the code, make sure you are in the folder where the web_app.py file and data files are located.
python web_app.py

```
